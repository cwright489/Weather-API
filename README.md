# Weather-API
I created a weather dashboard that uses the open weather API to call the big object
i then used ajax calls to pull the information i wanted and used jquery to post the divs
i used bootsrap and css to style the page itself.
the weather info displays on cards when a search value is entered
the search value is saved with local storage to be used in producing the weather results.
